This collection of Javascript files allow you to display a flexible worldmap using HTML5 canvas.

Things you can do include:

- Drawing the world map at different zoom levels, in the size of your choice.
- Customize the colors and border thickness of the map
- Color countries

Essential files you always need to include are:

- the Jquery library
- worldmap.js


If you wish to dynamically modify the worldmap, you also need to include:

- worldmap-control.js
- worldmap-control.html provides an example set of HTML controls (needs to be included via PHP/other means).

There are a couple examples included:

- worldmap-example.html is a "read-only" version highlighting several countries.
- worldmap.php is a dynamic version in which the user can custom repaint the map.

Enjoy!
